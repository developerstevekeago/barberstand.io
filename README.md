# 💈 BarberStand.io – CSS Transitions Practice Project

**BarberStand.io** is a clean, simple landing page concept designed for a barbershop brand. This project was built using only **HTML** and **CSS** with a focus on **CSS transitions and hover effects**. It was a learning project to help me understand how to add smooth animations that enhance user experience without JavaScript.

## 🎯 Project Goal

This was a practice project to learn and apply:

- **CSS Transitions** — to create smooth animations on hover and focus states
- **Basic UI design principles** — such as spacing, contrast, and typography
- **Landing page layout** — common in small business websites

The idea was to simulate what a basic branded barbershop website might look like, with interactive buttons, styled sections, and smooth movement on hover.

## 🧪 What I Practiced

### ✅ CSS Concepts:
- `transition` property for smooth effects
- `transform: scale()` to make buttons grow slightly on hover
- `hover` pseudo-class to trigger visual changes
- Box shadows and background changes with transition delays
- Visual feedback on interactive elements (like CTA buttons)

### ✅ Layout:
- Hero section with bold headline and CTA
- Minimalist structure using divs and semantic HTML tags
- Flexbox (if used) for alignment and spacing (optional depending on your code)

## 🛠️ Built With

- **HTML5** – page structure and content  
- **CSS3** – layout, styling, and animations  
- No external libraries or JavaScript used
